# Brief Background

Hi, I'm **Scott Hardie**. I serve as **Solutions Architect** at **McGraw Hill**, one of the world's leading educational technology companies, where I deliver trusted service and support by solving complex business problems with accessible technology and intuitive user design.

Before my current role, I held **Senior Digital Solutions Consultant** and **Portfolio Manager** positions at **McGraw Hill and Pearson Education**, driving profitable bespoke SaaS solutions that integrate seamlessly with existing IT infrastructure. My foundation combines strategic business development with technical architecture, spanning over 15 years across Canada's educational technology sector.

Earlier in my career, I built a track record in **academic research and university teaching**â€”before transitioning into educational publishing sales and eventually evolving into technical solution architecture. This unique progression from academia through sales to technology gives me a distinctive perspective on both the educational needs and technical requirements of learning solutions.

The collection below showcases **AI agents** I developed as part of the **AI Agent Certification Bootcamp** led by the exceptional team at MindStudio. Out of over 14,000 applicants, I was blessed to be selected as one of just 500 participants in this highly competitive programme.

As my professional responsibilities have grownâ€”leading complex technical implementations whilst maintaining my client advocacy focusâ€”I've made a deliberate effort to stay rooted in **hands-on learning and technical innovation**. This portfolio reflects that ongoing commitment to building, experimenting, and exploring what's possible with AI in educational contexts.

I hope you find something here that sparks insight or inspiration.
